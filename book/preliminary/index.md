# Preliminary Work

We welcome all types of learners to our event, from professional software developers to people just getting started. Based on previous experience, participants gain more from our hackweeks when they arrive having a preliminary understand of some of the foundational tools of data science workflows. These skills include knowing how to:

* Navigate a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) environment
* Conduct file management, text editing and other basic tasks from a command line interface
* Add and commit changes in Git, and push and pull content from GitHub
* Create simple scientific workflows in Python

## {{hackweek}} Software Carpentry Session

For anyone wishing to brush up on fundamentals, or for those of you who are new to open source workflows. We have a two-day recorded crash course that you can go over in advance of the hackweek: [Software Carpentry Schedule](swc).

Visit our [Introduction to Jupyter Hub](jupyterhub) page to learn more!

### Git

All content of the hackweek will be shared via GitHub and interacting with the
website will be done via the `git` command. Visit [Setting up the `git` command](git)
to learn how to configure that!

### EarthData Login

We'll have you download some data from NSIDC for your tutorials and projects.
Visit our [Earthdata](earthdata) page to learn how to access and Earthdata login account if you don't already have one!

## Optional setup

### Python
Dive deeper into how [Python is managed and installed](python) on the JupyterHub
and how you can install that on your personal machine.
