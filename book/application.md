## Considerations

Hackweeks are participant-driven events that encourage collaboration and teamwork. We welcome people from a diverse range of career stages, experience levels, backgrounds and identities.

Participant selection will be made with the goal of enhancing the diversity of our communities and building lasting connections that foster open science and data sharing.
Our events are often over-subscribed so we ask that you ensure you can attend the majority of our sessions during {{dates}} before applying.
