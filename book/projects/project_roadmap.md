## **Project Ideation and Team formation**

### Weeks Before the Event

Ideally the project work begins in advance of the hackweek. As soon as you are accepted to the event we will invite you to Slack where you can begin sharing project ideas:

{fa}`check,text-success mr-1` Have an idea for a project? Pitch it on the hackweek Slack group #project-ideas channel

{fa}`check,text-success mr-1` If you don't yet have an idea brewing, take time to browse other ideas on Slack. Start up a conversation in a Slack thread if something catches your eye.

{fa}`check,text-success mr-1` Feel free to consult with one of the organizers if you have questions about project purpose, scope, roles and datasets.

{fa}`check,text-success mr-1` You may already have a critical mass forming. This is great! Go ahead and begin defining [project roles](project_roles) so that you can arrive at the hackweek ready to get started.

### Day 1 of the Event

We facilitate a project team formation session at the end of the first day of the event.

{fa}`check,text-success mr-1` People with project ideas will make a 1-minute pitch to the group

{fa}`check,text-success mr-1` People looking for a project are invited into small groups to learn more about existing ideas

{fa}`check,text-success mr-1` UW eScience helpers and facilitators are available to help teams get clear on size and scope of the effort

## **Teamwork**

* kick-off meeting focuses on hearing from each team member:
    * What are your unique learning goals? 
    * How do you work best? What level of group interaction works for you?
    * What skills and background are you most excited to share with the team?
    * When are you available to meet?
* set up team computing infrastructure on Slack and GitHub ([Project Initiallization](project_initialization)) 
* project work begins and teams have regular check-ins to chart progress
* project outputs are recorded in a GitHub repository

## **Presentations** 

* each team has 15 minutes to share what was learned, what challenges arose, what might be worth trying next
* individual contributions to the group effort are recognized and celebrated

## **Communities of Practice**

* We aspire to keep projects going after the hackweek! This is an optional (ideal) outcome of hackweek project work.
* Project leads/helpers will transition to longer-term engagement via mentorship role (optional/with support).
* Additional people join a growing Community of Practice (for example, centered on a community software library).
* software, research results are packaged and shared/published.
