# Projects

During hackweeks we invite participants to collaborate in small group project teams (usually 5-7 people). Projects provide unique opportunities for networking, advancing research and learning new things:

We encourage you to be creative in how you design your project work! Here are some ways people have used project time in the past:


* *focus on learning*: dive deeper into tutorial content and gain more hands on experience with new tools
* *focus on community building*: hackweeks bring people together for the first time and projects are used to build social fabric and foster open science
* *focus on research*: people often work to advance a research challenge using tools shared during the event. This often includes ongoing graduate and postgraduate investigations.
* *focus on creating new tools*: hackweeks often expose general community software needs. Projects can be the catalyst for new community libraries.
