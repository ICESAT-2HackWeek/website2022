```{note}
{{hackweek}} will be offered virtually March 21 - 25. The purpose of the event is to coalesce people and resources around exploring, creating, and promoting effective computation and analysis workflows that utilize NASA's ICESat-2 mission.
```

📖 On this JupyterBook website you'll find [tutorials](tutorials/index). All tutorials are Jupyter Notebooks, designed to be run interactively, but also rendered on this website for convenience.

👩‍💻 Teams work collaboratively on different projects. Read more about the projects and results on our [projects page](projects/list_of_projects)
