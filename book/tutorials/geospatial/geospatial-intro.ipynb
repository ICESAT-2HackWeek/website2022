    "ICESat-2 elevations are spatial point data. Spatial data contains information about _where_ on the surface of the Earth a certain feature is located, and there are many different ways to define this location. While this seems straightforward, two main characteristics of the Earth make defining locations difficult: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Earth is 3-dimensional (working with spatial data would be a lot easier if the world were flat)!\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Paper maps and computer screens are flat, which causes issues when we try to use them to display rounded shapes (like the Earth's surface). Making things even more difficult, _the irregular shape of the Earth means there is no one perfect model of its surface on which we could place our spatial data points_! Instead, we're left with many models of the Earth's surface that are optimized for different locations and purposes. "
