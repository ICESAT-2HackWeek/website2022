We can see that there is a significant loss in ice between 2011 and 2013, followed by a gradual decrease up through 2016. Interestingly, there is a non-negligible increase in ice height in 2018, which may explain the decrease in ice velocity for the same year.\n\nWe're going to try and do the same thing, but for ICESat-2. Because it was launched in late-2018, we are going to try and grab interseasonal measurements from RGT 338 for 2019-2021.","metadata":{},"id":"0c1dc30c-d807-441b-804f-0c4ab1bd07f7"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Time to go through the icepyx routine again!\nimport icepyx as ipx\n\n# Specifying the necessary icepyx parameters\nshort_name = 'ATL06'\nlat_bounds = [69.1982, 69.2113]\nspatial_extent = [-50, 69.1982, -48.5, 69.2113] # KML polygon centered on Jakobshavan\ndate_range = ['2019-04-01', '2021-12-30']\nrgts = ['338'] # IS-2 RGT of interest","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"8c4f1417-d575-4c6c-affc-0834425df49f"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Setup the Query object\nregion = ipx.Query(short_name, spatial_extent, date_range, tracks=rgts)\n\n# Show the available granules\nregion.avail_granules(ids=True)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"c67e314d-f9c4-4014-824a-88ac238e70c0"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Set Earthdata credentials\nuid = 'zhfair'\nemail = 'zhfair@umich.edu'\nregion.earthdata_login(uid, email)\n\n# Order the granules\nregion.order_granules()","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"24552df8-9bba-4754-9e16-7aa70ee99aa8"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"path = '/home/jovyan/website2022/book/tutorials/DataIntegration/'\nregion.download_granules(path)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"00221419-857c-43a9-a1f6-589691d250ed"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import h5py\n\n%matplotlib widget\n\n# Iterate through the files to grab elevation, and derive elevation differences relative to April 2019\nfiles = ['processed_' + granule for granule in region.avail_granules(ids=True)[0]]\n\n# Get the initial data from April 2019\nwith h5py.File(files[0]) as f:\n    elev_42019 = f['gt2l/land_ice_segments/h_li'][:]\n    lat_42019 = f['gt2l/land_ice_segments/latitude'][:]\n    plt.plot(lat_42019, elev_42019, label=files[0][16:24])\n\ndelta_h = [0]\nstd_h = [0]\nfor file in files[1:]:\n    try:\n        with h5py.File(file) as f:\n            cloud_flag = np.mean(f['gt2l/land_ice_segments/geophysical/cloud_flg_asr'][:])\n            # Filter out cloudy scenes\n            if cloud_flag < 2:\n                lat = f['gt2l/land_ice_segments/latitude'][:]\n                elev = f['gt2l/land_ice_segments/h_li'][:]\n                date = file[16:24] # Get date of IS-2 overpass\n                \n                # Find the difference relative to April 2019\n                delta_h.append(np.mean(elev - elev_42019))\n                std_h.append(np.std(elev - elev_42019))\n                \n                # Plot the elevation data\n                plt.plot(lat, elev, label=date)\n            else:\n                print('Cloudy scene - no data loaded')\n    except:\n            print('Cloudy scene - no data loaded')\n            \nplt.xlabel('latitude')\nplt.ylabel('elevation [m]')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"5c86405a-c311-4264-828a-d99edf2cf3c3"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Plot the ice sheet change time series\ndates = ['20190420','20200117', '20200717', '202110115']\n%matplotlib widget\nplt.errorbar(dates, delta_h, yerr=std_h, marker='.', markersize=12, capsize=4)\nplt.xlabel('date')\nplt.ylabel('$\\Delta$ h [m]')\nplt.show()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"eeb2b388-06c2-4587-bd45-2eb96d99972e"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There we go!
