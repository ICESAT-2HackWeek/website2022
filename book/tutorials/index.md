# Tutorials

These tutorials consist of Jupyter Notebooks that can be run in our
{{ '[Event JupyterHub]({url})'.format(url=jupyterhub_url) }}
If you are attending the hackweek, you have access to a JupyterHub environment
with all the necessary Python software packages installed that are needed to run
through these tutorials interactively. On JupyterHub, your home directory persists
so any changes you make to the tutorials will be saved and be there for you next
time you log in.

All live tutorial recordings available via UW eScience [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/c/UWeScienceInstitute/playlists). Or see the table below for links to specific tutorial notebooks and recordings:
