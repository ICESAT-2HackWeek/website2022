    "# Data Discovery and Access via **earthdata** library\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Credits\n",
    "* Notebook by: Luis Lopez and Mikala Beig\n",
    "* Source material: [earthdata demo notebook](https://github.com/nsidc/earthdata) by Luis Lopez\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use programmatic data access to discover and access NASA DAAC data using the **earthdata** library .\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation and Background\n",
    "**earthdata**  uses NASA APIs to search, preview and access NASA datasets on-prem and in the cloud (with 4 lines of Python!).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to access NASA datasets. We can use the Earthdata Search portal. We can use DAAC specific portals or tools.\n",
    "We could even use data.gov! These web portals are great but... they are not designed for programmatic access and reproducible workflows. \n",
    "This is extremely important in the age of the cloud and reproducible open science.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that NASA also exposes APIs that allows us to search, transform and access data in a programmatic way. \n",
    "There are already some very useful client libraries for these APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* python-cmr\n",
    "* eo-metadata-tools\n",
    "* harmony-py\n",
    "* Hyrax (OpenDAP)\n",
    "* cmr-stac\n",
    "* others\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these libraries has amazing features and some similarities. \n",
    "* [cmr-stac](https://medium.com/pangeo/intake-stac-nasa-4cd78d6246b7) is probably the best option for a streamlined workflow from dataset search and discovery to efficiently loading data using python libraries like pandas or xarray.\n",
    "* [*Harmony-py*](https://harmony.earthdata.nasa.gov/) is the more capable client if we want to pre process the data beforehand(reformat NetCDF to Zarr, reproject, subset). Unfortunately not all datasets are yet covered by Harmony.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, **earthdata** aims to be a simple library that can deal with the important parts of the metadata so we can access or download data without having to worry if a given dataset is on-prem or in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps for Programmatic Data Access\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few key steps for accessing data from the NASA DAAC APIs:\n",
    "1. Authenticate with NASA Earthdata Login (and for cloud-hosted data with AWS access keys and token).\n",
    "2. Query CMR to find data using spatial and temporal filters.\n",
    "3. Order and download your data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll go through each of these steps during this tutorial, at the end summarizing how `earthdata` streamlines this process into a minimal number of lines of code.\n",
